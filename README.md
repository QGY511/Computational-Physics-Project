# Computational Physics with C++ and ROOT

Welcome to my Computational Physics project. This project uses C++ programming language and the ROOT data analysis framework developed by CERN. 

## Description

This project aims to solve complex computational physics problems using the power of C++ and the flexibility of ROOT for data analysis. The computational physics part includes but is not limited to Monte Carlo, integration, 2D motions, and some quantum physics.

The ROOT part is used to visualize and make animations. (You can try Python to do that, which seems to be a popular way)

## Installation

I recommend installing ROOT environment via Homebrew.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- A modern C++ compiler (gcc, clang)
- ROOT (https://root.cern/install/)


## License and Permission

Do not use the code for any academic assignments that will violate academic integrity.
