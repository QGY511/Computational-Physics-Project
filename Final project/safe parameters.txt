 There are three conditions need to be considered in designing a bungee cord.
1.The lowest of the motion can not exceed h=-134, otherwise the jumper will hit the ground. In my design, the Lowest point is -123 which does nor exceed h. 
2.The maximum elastic force on the jumper does not exceed 3mg because large elastic force may hurt the jumper. In my design, the maximum elastic force is 2196<3*78*9.81=2295.5.
3.It is typically required that the cord stretches by less than 300% because over-stretching a bungee cord may break the bungee cord irreversibly. In my design, the maximum stretch is just 120% which is less than 300%. 

Values for parameters:
a=0.015^2*pi=7.069*10^-4.
l=56.
